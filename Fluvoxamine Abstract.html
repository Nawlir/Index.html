            <h2>Fluvoxamine</h2>
              <h4>Abstract</h4>
              <br>
              <p>Fluvoxamine is a drug used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder. It works by boosting serotonin levels between nerve cells in the brain. It possesses biological properties that may help it combat COVID-19-induced inflammation. Fluvoxamine is a prescription drug that has been in use for two to three decades. It costs ten dollars and is available at any pharmacy in the United States. The researchers conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, adaptive platform trial in Minas Gerasis, Brazil, to see if fluvoxamine could prevent COVID-19 progression and hospitalization in outpatients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Additional agents can be introduced and tested with standardized operating procedures defined in a single protocol thanks to this architecture. The scientists reported on the clinical evaluation of fluvoxamine using a concurrent placebo control group, which was one of eight treatments investigated in this platform trial. This placebo-controlled, randomized, adaptive platform trial comprised eligible patients from 11 clinical sites in Brazil who were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had a recognized risk factor for progression to severe disease. Fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for ten days) or placebo were given to patients at random (1:1). (or other treatment groups not reported). Treatment allocation was kept a secret from the trial team, site workers, and patients.</p>
