    <h2>Molnupiravir</h2>
    <h4>Abstract</h4>  
    <br>
    <p>Molnupiravir is an isopropylester prodrug of the nucleoside analog β-D-N4- hydroxycytidine (NHC or EIDD-1931). Molnupiravir interferes with the replication of  various viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. It inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung  tissue, blocks SARS-CoV-2 transmission in ferrets and reduces SARS-CoV-2 RNA in  patients. In contrast to approved drugs such as remdesivir that are administered by infusion,  molnupiravir is orally available. Molnupiravir has been tested in phase I trial for safety,  tolerability and pharmacokinetics, and phase II/III studies are currently ongoing  (NCT04405739, NCT04405570 and NCT04575597). Available data suggest that  molnupiravir acts as a mutagenizing agent that causes an ‘error catastrophe’ during viral  replication. Indeed, NHC can introduce mutations into viral RNA, as shown for Venezuelan  equine encephalitis virus. Also, the sequencing of influenza virus populations has indicated  that NHC causes G-to-A and C-to-U transitions in viral RNA, and the same transitions have  been found for SARS-CoV-2.

    <p>Molnupiravir increases the frequency of covid-19 RNA mutations and impairs the viral  replication in animal models and in humans. It is a two-step mutagenesis mechanism that  applies to various viral polymerases and explains the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of  molnupiravir.</p>
    <p>The method uses molecular mechanisms (a,c,d) underlying molnupiravir-induced  RNA mutagenesis by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Biochemical  analysis shows that the RdRp uses the active form of molnupiravir, β-D-N4-hydroxycytidine  (NHC) triphosphate, as a substrate instead of cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate.  When the RdRp utilizes the resulting RNA as a template, NHC directs incorporation of either  G or A, leading to mutated RNA products. Structural analysis of RdRp–RNA complexes that  contain mutagenesis products shows that NHC can form stable base pairs with either G or A  in the RdRp active center, explaining how the polymerase escapes proofreading and  synthesizes mutated RNA.

    <h4>Results and Discussion of the Mechanism of Molnupiravir, Remdesivir,  Fluvoxamine (FLV)

    <h4>Similarities(Molnupiravir and Remdesivier):</h4>
    <br>
    <p>-Scientists had to repeat many of their toxicological studies with mice, dogs, and  monkeys. <br><br>
    -Molnupiravir, like remdesivir, is a nucleoside analogue, which means it mimics some  of the building blocks of RNA.<br><br>
    - Both prodrugs are blocking group at its 5’-OH group.<br><br>
    - Molnupiravir and Fluvoxamine are both available as immediate release tablets and  controlled-release capsules.<br><br>
    - Fluvoxamine and Molnupiravir are both currently in Phase 3 of their clinical trials.
    </p>
    <h4>Difference(Molnupiravir and Remdesivier):</h4>
    <br>
    <p>- When SARS-CoV-2 enters a cell, the virus needs to duplicate its RNA genome to  form new viruses. Remdesivir is a “chain terminator.” It stops the enzyme that builds  these RNA “chains” from adding further links.
        <br><br>
        - Remdesirvir interacts with the outside spike proteins of corona.<br><br>
        - Even though both attacks the 5’-OH group, they attack it in diverse ways.  - Molnupiravir, on the other hand, gets incorporated into the RNA strands, once inside,  wreaks havoc. Molnupiravir exists in two forms, which are known as tautomers, and  switching between them causes mismatching during transcription. So, when the virus  grows in the presence of EIDD-1931, its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase reads the  compound as uridine instead of cytidine and therefore puts an adenosine where it  should insert a guanosine. This misreading creates a massive number of mutations in  the viral genome and the copied viruses cannot function. When enough mutations  accumulate, the viral population collapses. 
        <br><br>
        - Whilst Remdesivir is administered by blood infusion.<br><br>
        - The exact mechanism of Fluvoxamine’s protective effect in COVID-19 is still partly  unknown and is probably multifactorial. Fluvoxamine, next to its antidepressant and  anxiolytic effects, seems to possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. As  a potential lysosomotropic agent, it could also be capable of influencing endolysosomal  trafficking and preventing the hypercoagulative state in COVID-19.
        <br><br>
        - A study published in 2019 demonstrated on an animal model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- induced sepsis that fluvoxamine had anti-inflammatory properties mediated through its  interaction with the sigma-1 receptor (S1R), thus acting protectively against  hypercytokinemia (cytokine storm). The same study also found that fluvoxamine  significantly reduced the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, IL-12, and IL-8 induced  by LPS in human heparinized peripheral blood. This research leads to the conclusion of Anti inflammatory and immunomodulatory action.
