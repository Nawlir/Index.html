            <h2>Similarities & Differences</h2>
            <br>
            <h4>Similarities(Molnupiravir and Remdesivier):</h4>
            <br>
            <p>-Scientists had to repeat many of their toxicological studies with mice, dogs, and  monkeys. <br><br>
            -Molnupiravir, like remdesivir, is a nucleoside analogue, which means it mimics some  of the building blocks of RNA.<br><br>
            - Both prodrugs are blocking group at its 5’-OH group.<br><br>
            - Molnupiravir and Fluvoxamine are both available as immediate release tablets and  controlled-release capsules.<br><br>
            - Fluvoxamine and Molnupiravir are both currently in Phase 3 of their clinical trials.

            <h4>Difference(Molnupiravir and Remdesivier):</h4>
            <br>
            <p>- When SARS-CoV-2 enters a cell, the virus needs to duplicate its RNA genome to  form new viruses. Remdesivir is a “chain terminator.” It stops the enzyme that builds  these RNA “chains” from adding further links.
                <br><br>
                - Remdesirvir interacts with the outside spike proteins of corona.<br><br>
                - Even though both attacks the 5’-OH group, they attack it in diverse ways.  - Molnupiravir, on the other hand, gets incorporated into the RNA strands, once inside,  wreaks havoc. Molnupiravir exists in two forms, which are known as tautomers, and  switching between them causes mismatching during transcription. So, when the virus  grows in the presence of EIDD-1931, its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase reads the  compound as uridine instead of cytidine and therefore puts an adenosine where it  should insert a guanosine. This misreading creates a massive number of mutations in  the viral genome and the copied viruses cannot function. When enough mutations  accumulate, the viral population collapses. 
                <br><br>
                - Whilst Remdesivir is administered by blood infusion.<br><br>
                - The exact mechanism of Fluvoxamine’s protective effect in COVID-19 is still partly  unknown and is probably multifactorial. Fluvoxamine, next to its antidepressant and  anxiolytic effects, seems to possess anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. As  a potential lysosomotropic agent, it could also be capable of influencing endolysosomal  trafficking and preventing the hypercoagulative state in COVID-19.
                <br><br>
                - A study published in 2019 demonstrated on an animal model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- induced sepsis that fluvoxamine had anti-inflammatory properties mediated through its  interaction with the sigma-1 receptor (S1R), thus acting protectively against  hypercytokinemia (cytokine storm). The same study also found that fluvoxamine  significantly reduced the production of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 beta, IL-12, and IL-8 induced  by LPS in human heparinized peripheral blood. This research leads to the conclusion of Anti inflammatory and immunomodulatory action.
