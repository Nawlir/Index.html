            <h2>Fluvoxamine</h2>
              <h4>Abstract</h4>
              <br>
              <p>Fluvoxamine is a drug used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder. It works by boosting serotonin levels between nerve cells in the brain. It possesses biological properties that may help it combat COVID-19-induced inflammation. Fluvoxamine is a prescription drug that has been in use for two to three decades. It costs ten dollars and is available at any pharmacy in the United States. The researchers conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, adaptive platform trial in Minas Gerasis, Brazil, to see if fluvoxamine could prevent COVID-19 progression and hospitalization in outpatients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. Additional agents can be introduced and tested with standardized operating procedures defined in a single protocol thanks to this architecture. The scientists reported on the clinical evaluation of fluvoxamine using a concurrent placebo control group, which was one of eight treatments investigated in this platform trial. This placebo-controlled, randomized, adaptive platform trial comprised eligible patients from 11 clinical sites in Brazil who were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 and had a recognized risk factor for progression to severe disease. Fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for ten days) or placebo were given to patients at random (1:1). (or other treatment groups not reported). Treatment allocation was kept a secret from the trial team, site workers, and patients.</p>

      <h4>Mechanism</h4>
      <br>
        <p>The exact method by which fluvoxamine treats COVID-19 disease is unknown. Although numerous potential mechanisms have been proposed, the fundamental motivation for the early investigation of fluvoxamine as a COVID-19 therapy was its anti-inflammatory effect via S1R activation (Sigma-1 Receptor). S1R is a chaperone for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Membrane protein has a role in a variety of cellular processes, including stress response-unfolded protein response regulation and cytokine production modulation in response to inflammatory triggers. S1R may block the ER stress sensor inositol-requiring enzyme 1a from splicing and activating the mRNA of X-box protein 1, a critical regulator of cytokine production that includes interleukins IL-6, IL-8, IL-1, and IL-12, in the presence of fluvoxamine. Fluvoxamine exhibited efficacy in preclinical models of inflammation and sepsis through this mechanism in a 2019 study (by Rosen and colleagues). The antiplatelet action of fluvoxamine could be a second pathway. SSRs can block serotonin loading into [platelets and limit platelet activation, which could lessen the risk of thrombosis, and these antiplatelet effects can be cardioprotective. Finally, fluvoxamine's ability to increase melatonin levels in the bloodstream could represent a potential mechanism of action. To assist define the most likely mechanism, in vitro and animal research are required. Future randomized controlled trials with biomarker research could potentially help to explain mechanisms.<br><br>
        <strong>Reasons why FLV is proposed as a potential drug Canidate for COVID-19:</strong>
          <ol class="curr">
            <li>Reduced serotonin uptake by platelets.</li>
            <li>Reduced histamine release from mast cells.</li>
            <li>Lysosomotrophic effects interfering with viral trafficking.</li>
            <li>Interference with lysosomal membrane binding of Acid Sphingomyelinase (ASM).</li>
            <li>S1R agonism and effects on IRE1-mediated inflammation.</li>
            <li>Increased melatonin levels.</li>
          </ol>
  </p>

      <h4>Platelet Aggregation</h4>
      <br>
        <p>Fluvoxamine blocks the reuptake of serotonin at the sodium-dependent serotonin transporter (SERT) of the neuronal membrane. Another fluvoxamine hypothesis relates with platelet aggregation due to platelets lacking the enzyme to synthesize serotonin. (Ni and watts, 2006). A SERT enables rapid uptake of serotonin from plasma (Vanhoutte, 1991). During thrombosis platelets release serotonin, facilitating hemostasis through platelet aggregation (Berger et al., 2009) (Figure 1), and promoting recruitment of neutrophils (Duerschmied et al., 2013). A hyper-serotonergic state distinguishes COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome, biochemically (Zaid et al., 2021) and clinically (Helms et al., 2020a; Helms et al., 2020b). This is likely pathologic across a multitude of organs (akin to serotonin syndrome, F. Jalali—personal observation and communication) and may originate from an immune-mediated (Althaus et al., 2020; Nazy et al., 2021) state of platelet hyperreactivity (Zaid et al., 2021), resulting in florid platelet degranulation of serotonin into plasma.

  <h4>Mast Cell Degranulation</h4>
  <br>
    <p>Human mast cells (MCs) are a viral reservoir for RNA viruses like HIV (Sundstrom et al., 2004). Retinoic acid-inducible gene-like receptors of mast cells can detect RNA viruses (Fukuda et al., 2013). Viruses can cause degranulation of MCs in a Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) -dependent pathway (Wang et al., 2012). MCs express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the principal receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, thus defining a route by which MCs could become hosts for this virus (Theoharides, 2020).
    </p>
    <hr>
  <h4>Lysomotropism</h4>
  <br>
    <p>S1R agonists like FLV and fluoxetine are lysosomotropic (Hallifax and Houston, 2007; Kazmi et al., 2013). Fluvoxamine has a predicted pKa of 8.86 (DrugBank, 2005; Wishart et al., 2018) and is susceptible to protonation in the physiological pH range. Less polar, unionized form of basic drugs can easily cross membranes. Basic drugs like FLV can get protonated in the lysosome, which hinders the now-charged moieties from crossing membranes. β-coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2 and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), use lysosomal trafficking to escape from infected cells (Ghosh et al., 2020)(Image). Given the lysosomal egress of β-coronaviruses from infected cells, lysosomotropic drugs like FLV could have antiviral effects in the virus-laden lysosomes (Homolak and Kodvanj, 2020) (Image).</p>
    <hr>
  <h4>Acid Sphingomyelinase</h4>
  <br>
    <p>Lysomotropic drugs displace acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) from lysosomal membranes leading to its degradation (Breiden and Sandhoff, 2019) (Image). Treatment of mice with S1R(Sigma 1 Receptor) agonists like fluoxetine (Hasinmoto, 2015) reduces both acid sphingomyelinase activity and protein levels in neurons (Gulbins et al., 2013). Inhibition of acid sphingomyelase by these drugs can prevent the conversion of sphingomyelin to cell membrane facilities viral entry, this reduction in ceramide may prevent infection (Carpenterio et al., 2020). Therefore, functional inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase by lysomotropic drugs is another avenue of viral control by antidepressants.

  <h4>Melatonin</h4>
  <br>
    <p>SARS-CoV-2 virus can activate NLRP3 inflammasome (van den Berg and Te Velde, 2020), which along with NF-κB activation can induce cytokine storm (Ratajczak and Kucia, 2020). Melatonin can mitigate inflammation through these pathways and melatonin exposure post-intubation is associated with a positive outcome in COVID-19 (and non-COVID-19) patients (Garcia et al., 2015; Ramlall et al., 2020). FLV can elevate melatonin levels via inhibition of CYP1A2, a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes (Hartter et al., 2001) (Image).</p>
  <hr>
  <h4>Clinical Effects of Fluvoxamine in Covid-19</h4>
  <br>
    <p>In a double-blind, randomized, preliminary study of adult outpatients with symptomatic COVID-19, 80 patients treated with FLV, compared to 72 treated with placebo, had a lower likelihood of clinical deterioration over 15 days (Lenze et al., 2020). Given the multiple roles of S1R reviewed here in inflammation, platelet aggregation, antiviral activity etc. and the recent striking human data, it is likely that S1R agonists like FLV could have a major impact on disease progression of COVID-19 patients in the early stage of the disease.

  <h4>Results/Discussion</h4>
  <br>
    <p>To date, scientists have assessed over 9803 potential participants for this study. This could be the first large randomized controlled experiment to examine fluvoxamine's efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19. On the primary outcome of hospitalization defined as either retention in a COVID-19 emergency setting or transfer to a tertiary hospital due to COVID-19, there is a clinically important absolute risk reduction of 5.0 percent and a 32 percent relative risk reduction following the administration of fluvoxamine for ten days. This is the second trial to suggest that a repurposed medicine had a greater impact benefit in the early treatment population. These findings may affect national and international standards on the clinical care of COVID-19 because to fluvoxamine's safety, tolerability, ease of use, low cost, and broad availability. The findings are in line with those of a previous, smaller trial conducted in the United States. Although that trial employed a greater dose of fluvoxamine and included a lower-risk group for the primary outcome, it identified no clinical error among 80 fluvoxamine patients compared to six occurrences among 72 placebo patients. Another study in France looked at 7230 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and found that using SSRIs (Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) reduced the need for intubation or mortality.
